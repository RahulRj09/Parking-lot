There is a Parking lot: which has 20 Parking spots
And assume only there are three types of vehicles, which are Bike, Car, Bus

Bike needs 1 spots
Car need 2 spots
Bus needs 4 Spots

When ever some vehicles comes, before parking, it has to check is there any free spot, and can it park there or not based on itâ€™s size

Parking lot has to keep track of the number of spots whenever vehicles parks and unparks.
